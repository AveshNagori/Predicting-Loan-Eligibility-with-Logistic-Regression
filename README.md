# Predicting-Loan-Eligibility-with-Logistic-Regression

This project focuses on predicting loan approval for individuals and MSMEs using a logistic regression model. The dataset is provided by LoanTap, an online lending platform that offers various types of loans, including personal loans and loans for businesses.

## Project Overview

LoanTap’s data science team aims to build an underwriting model to determine the creditworthiness of borrowers. The primary goal is to predict whether a loan application should be approved or rejected based on several financial and demographic attributes of the applicants. This project involves exploratory data analysis (EDA), feature engineering, and the development of a logistic regression model to assess the likelihood of loan repayment.

## Problem Statement

Given a set of attributes for an individual, predict whether a personal loan should be extended to them. Additionally, offer business recommendations on repayment terms based on the model’s output.

- **Python**: For data manipulation and analysis.
- **Pandas, NumPy**: For data preprocessing and feature engineering.
- **Matplotlib, Seaborn**: For visualizing data distributions and relationships.
- **Scikit-learn**: For building the logistic regression model and evaluating its performance.

## How This Helps

This project helps LoanTap streamline its credit approval process by identifying key indicators of creditworthiness and reducing the risk of default. The insights generated by the model can assist in making more informed decisions, ensuring that loans are extended to individuals and businesses that are most likely to repay.
